I'd be happy to help extract a failure lesson, but I need additional information about the actual failure that occurred. Could you please provide:

1. **The error message or logs** from the failed GitHub Actions run
2. **What the agent attempted** (what commands/edits did it try?)
3. **What the actual outcome was** (file not modified? syntax error? permission denied? etc.)

Without knowing the specific failure mode, I cannot extract an accurate, non-speculative lesson.

Once you share the failure details, I'll provide a lesson in the exact format you specified.
